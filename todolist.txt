Nice üëå ‚Äî a **checklist for a custom shell project** is a great way to stay organized. I‚Äôll give you a structured list, starting from **basic must-haves**, then **intermediate features**, and finally **advanced/bonus features** (if you want to impress teachers or go beyond).

---

## ‚úÖ **Basic Features (Core Shell Functionality)**

These are usually required for a minimal shell:

* [ ] **Prompt** that shows up repeatedly (e.g., `myshell >` or with `getcwd()`).
* [ ] **Read user input** (e.g., with `readline()` or `fgets()`).
* [ ] **Parse command line** into program + arguments.
* [ ] **Execute external commands** using `fork()` + `execvp()`.
* [ ] **Wait for child process** with `wait()` / `waitpid()`.
* [ ] Handle **`exit`** command to quit the shell.
* [ ] Handle **`cd <dir>`** (change directory).
* [ ] Handle **`cd` with no argument** (go to `$HOME`).
* [ ] Handle **`cd -`** (go back to previous directory).
* [ ] Handle errors properly (`perror()` when command fails).
* [ ] Avoid memory leaks (`free()` allocated memory).

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è **Intermediate Features (Real Shell Behavior)**

These make your shell usable and closer to Bash:

* [ ] **Show current directory in prompt** (`getcwd()`).
* [ ] **Add history support** (`readline` + `add_history()`).
* [ ] **Support `PATH` lookup** (so `ls` works without `./ls`).
* [ ] **Handle environment variables** (`getenv`, `setenv`, `unsetenv`, `printenv`).
* [ ] **Handle `~` expansion** (`cd ~` goes to `$HOME`).
* [ ] **Background processes** (`command &`) ‚Üí don‚Äôt wait for them.
* [ ] **Signal handling**:

  * [ ] Ignore `Ctrl+C` in the shell itself.
  * [ ] Allow `Ctrl+C` to kill child processes.
* [ ] **Multiple spaces/tabs** in command parsing.
* [ ] **Comments support** (ignore input after `#`).

---

## üöÄ **Advanced Features (Bonus/Extra Credit)**

These are not always required, but make your shell very cool:

* [ ] **Pipes** (`ls | grep txt`).
* [ ] **Redirection**:

  * [ ] Output redirection (`>`).
  * [ ] Input redirection (`<`).
  * [ ] Append (`>>`).
* [ ] **Chaining commands**:

  * [ ] Sequential (`;`).
  * [ ] Conditional (`&&`, `||`).
* [ ] **Job control**:

  * [ ] Suspend/resume jobs (`Ctrl+Z`, `fg`, `bg`).
* [ ] **Tab completion** (with `readline`‚Äôs completion hooks).
* [ ] **Custom built-ins** like:

  * `pwd`
  * `echo`
  * `help`
  * `alias` / `unalias`.
* [ ] **Configuration file** (like `.myshellrc`).
* [ ] **Colorized prompt** (user\@host, current dir, etc.).

---

## üìù **Project Hygiene**

Things teachers often grade too:

* [ ] **Clean code** (well-structured functions, not all in `main()`).
* [ ] **Error handling** (check return values of `malloc`, `fork`, `execvp`, etc.).
* [ ] **Memory management** (use `valgrind` to check leaks).
* [ ] **Modularity** (separate parsing, execution, built-ins into different functions/files).
* [ ] **Documentation** (README explaining features).
* [ ] **Test cases** (script that runs common commands and checks output).

---

‚ö° If you stick to **Basic + Intermediate**, you‚Äôll already have a very solid `myshell`.
If you add **a couple Advanced features**, it‚Äôll stand out.

üëâ Do you want me to turn this into a **step-by-step roadmap** (like ‚Äúfirst implement X, then add Y, then Z‚Äù), so you can build your shell incrementally without getting lost?
